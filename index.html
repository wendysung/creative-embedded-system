                        For this project, I was inspired by our (original) installation date: Valentine's Day &#x1F496;
                        As it was going to take place on Valentine's Day, I wanted to play with text and visual representations that
                        symbolized this holiday that celebrates love. For mean, a classic symbolism for Valentine's Day is the heart candies. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For my code, I created a list of different words commonly found on these heart candies, like 'Kiss Me', 'I Love You' and "Miss You".
                        Using the random seed function, my code would randomly generate these text one by one onto the bitmap header file of a heart emoji I uploaded with my code.

            <p>
                Over the course of this project, we ran into some technical difficulties that we didn't expect such as getting the code to run on some people's ESP32 
                displays and batteries smoking. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For uploading code to the display, this problem was quickly overcame by downloading an extra driver because I had a mac with newer OS versions. 
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html">Driver code link</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Our initial intention for the batteries was to solder it to the ESP32 display so we can hang them up in the hallway. However,
                due to safety issue we had dispose them safely and instead plug them into a board with USB-c connectors that is connected to a power supply. However, the board 
                turned out better than expected. I really liked the fact that we could see all the different ESP32 display together and they interact with one another. I also 
                thought the reflection of the colors from the displays onto the board was really pretty.
