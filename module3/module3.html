                        My project is an interactive visualization for heart beat meditation. After seeing a James Turrell's skyscape, I was inspired by him to create 
                        a space that encourages people to sit and observe the nature and space around them as well themsleves. To encourage people to look inward and 
                        be at peace, I was inspired by the Heart Rhythm Meditation method that coordinates our breath with our heartbeats to generate a powerful internal 
                        rhythm that creates heart coherence which is a state of balance with the head, heart, and body.
                        <br>
                        A person will sit in from of the projected screen and place their finger to a pulse sensor that is attached to a heart model. As the person sit and 
                        meditate, the heart model will glow in red to their heart beat. This heart beat will also be projected onto the screen and interact with the visualization I have created. 
                        It is my hope that the visualization will help the person see how their heart beat and breathing is adapting throughout their meditation.

                        <p>An LED in a circuit without a limiting resistor can easily exceed its maximum current and burn out. o calculate the resistor 
                            <br>values needed to protect the LED, use Ohmâ€™s Law V = I x R.
                            <br>
                            To calculate the resistor for the red LED, we need to take into account of its Forward Voltage and Forward Current into the Ohm's Law.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The forward voltage (V_F) is the voltage drop across the LED, and is thus subtracted from the supply voltage (V_S).</li>
                                <li>The forward voltage (V_F)is typically in the range of 1.8-2V for Red LED.</li> 
                                <li>The maximum forward current (I_F) is typically is 20mA for Red LED.</li> 
                            </ul>
                            For our project, the red LED has a V_F of 2V and I_F of 20mA, powered by 5V. Hence, we will be using a 150ohm resistor.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Overall, I have pushed myself outside of my comfort zone and learned a lot of new skills from this proeject, including 3D printing, Soldering, and using Touching Designer. This project was very exciting to implement because 
                creating an exhibiton-style work that would include projecting some sort of interactive visualization I created was something I always wanted to do. When I came across Touch Designer, I thought that it would be a cool way
                to explore this tool and utilize it in my project. Learning about Touch Designer is a long process that I am still getting used to. It's node-based visual programming language is something I have never encountered before but 
                once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use. For this project, I use online tutorials to help guide me through its tools and features. The hardest thing about working with TouchDesigner is probably not understanding 
                the full capabilities of it as there is always something new to learn and use, which is why I am sure that as I continue to play around with this tool I will be able to execute more complex designs by myself. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I also really enjoyed making the enclosure for this project. I thought the milky translucent PLA material worked really well on the Heart Model as it allowed the Red LED light to shine through, especially in the dark. Althought, the platform 
                I printed for the heart model was too small for the breadboard I have. For future adjustment, I would redesign the platform to be longer or to use a smaller breadboard.
