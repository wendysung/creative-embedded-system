                        For this project, I built a <span>collage maker</span> that allows users to use the joystick to move and place images one by one on top of a given background.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For my specific project, I am creating an interactive device that allows users to create digital collages. Through using a joystick, the user will go through 
                        a series of randomly ordered images to build their collage on a background. I was inspired by my childhood passion for making collages and vision boards, which 
                        often took days to finish and would always get very messy. With this digital collage builder, one no longer needs to indesisively gather images, painfully cut 
                        through them, and be left with sticky fingers upon finishing gluing it all together. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My code take the normalized coordinates of the x and y to determine the relative position of each image on the background as the user hovers it around. 
                        If the user presses down on the joystick, the changing state of the z value will signal the user's placement and move on to displaying the next image for moving. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After the user goes through all the images, they will have a complete collage that they can save!

                        <p>I found a wooden box that would fit the breadboard perfectly if I place it diagonally, which helps stabilize the breadboard.</p>
    
                        <p>I knew I wanted to joystick to be outside the box, but have the Joystick pins and wires covered. Wrapping the wrapping paper I got around the Joystick was the hard part. To do this, I measured out the rough size of the joystick circle and cut out a circle for it to fit through. 
                        <br><br>
                        Afterward, I taped down the joystick and wires to the lid so that I could stabilize them while I wrap paper over it.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I really enjoyed constructing an interactive device and enclosure for this project. Building hardwares something I have never experienced so it was really educational and empowering
                to learn to read hardware schematics and how it could interact with my creative code. A key challenge for me was figuring out why the Z values from the joystick was not responding, 
                The class discussion chat was helpful in getting suggestions on debugging the solution and in the end it took trial and error to figure out which pins was not compatible.</p>
